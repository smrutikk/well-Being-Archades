The problem statement given by Ministry of Education for Smart India Hackathon 2023 was:
Develop a model/software which will help students to assess mental health of students, build methods to find out and provide solution for the improvement.

Our solution encompasses a portal where in a assessment of student's mental health is done using gamified questionnaires which are based on Rational emotive behavior therapy (REBT).
After immense research and surveys from various psychologist and counsellors the questions are developed in such a way that they are relevant to student's life scenarios.

After this assessment students can use the platform for various mindful activities such as Guided Meditation, Journalling, Practising Yoga,etc.
